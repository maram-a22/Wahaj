The development process of the WAHAJ app involved a comprehensive approach to creating a platform for art enthusiasts. It began with extensive research on art styles, techniques, and popular artists to understand the target audience's needs. The development team then focused on designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, incorporating features like curated collections and search filters for easy exploration of artworks. Social features were integrated to facilitate engagement, and educational resources were included to enhance art knowledge.  User feedback and testing played a crucial role in refining the app's features, and regular updates were made based on insights and market trends. The overall goal was to create an engaging and immersive art experience for users, while providing a platform for artists to showcase their work.
